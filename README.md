Spotify-Vibe-Jukebox-Android-app
================================

Vibe is an app that lets you create a jukebox where other users can add songs to the queue. 
Instead of having one single person choose the music to be played, you can search and add your own songs to the song queue and 
set the vibe for the event. 

Vibe is easy to use and gives everybody a chance to play their music also encouraging discovery. 
To be able to play music you must have a Spotify Premium account. 

This version includes: 
- Create your own jukebox 
- Select a playlist from your saved playlists on Spotify

- Join a nearby jukebox (based on location)
-  Add songs form a search activity


** There are still some problems when interacting the app between android and iphone versions, that will be fixed very shortly. 

This app is a first effort as a way to learn Android application development and using the Spotify Web-API. There will be regular 
updates to improve the architecture and the coding in general.
